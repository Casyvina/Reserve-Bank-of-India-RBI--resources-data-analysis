# AIM -
The Aim of this project is to make valuable predictions on **year over year growth** which is very essential in investment banking considering India, as investors usually want to see your year-over-year numbers before supplying you with business capital as well as YOY is a great statistic to use when you want to control the effects of volatility when comparing companies or economies.

# CONTENT -
In order to make predictions on year over year growth we have gathered data from Reserve bank of India. Followings parameters have been taken into account to make predictions on year over year growth including Fortnight Ended , Non-food Bank Credit , 	Investments in Commercial Paper ,Investments in shares,	Investments in Bonds/Debentures,	Total Non-SLR Investments and	Adjusted Non-food Bank Credit.

# Algorithms Used :


# AdaBoost -
AdaBoost is best used to boost the performance of decision trees on binary classification problems.AdaBoost was originally called AdaBoost.M1 by the authors of the technique Freund and Schapire. More recently it may be referred to as discrete AdaBoost because it is used for classification rather than regression.AdaBoost can be used to boost the performance of any machine learning algorithm. It is best used with weak learners. These are models that achieve accuracy just above random chance on a classification problem.The most suited and therefore most common algorithm used with AdaBoost are decision trees with one level.
# TPOT :
TPOT is meant to be an assistant that gives you ideas on how to solve a particular machine learning problem by exploring pipeline configurations that you might have never considered, then leaves the fine-tuning to more constrained parameter tuning techniques such as grid search.So TPOT helps you find good algorithms.

TPOT is built on the scikit learn library and follows the scikit learn API closely. It can be used for regression and classification tasks and has special implementations for medical research.

# CONCLUSION 

Prediction of Year over year growth rate is a regression problem so to make predictions we have used powerful regression algorithm like AdaBoost regressor and some new machine learning algorithm (AUTOML) like TPOT regressor.
